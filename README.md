## 🚀 Projects

### [Human Fall Detection using Computer Vision](https://github.com/neerajghate/human-fall-detection)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-blue)
![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/Library-TensorFlow-orange)
![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-OpenCV-red)
![Accuracy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Accuracy-98%25-brightgreen)

A sophisticated system using 2D ConvNet for Motion History Image (MHI) classification, achieving 98% accuracy in detecting human falls. Implemented real-time alert mechanisms to notify caretakers or family members in case of a fall event. Conducted performance evaluations and fine-tuning to optimize the system's reliability.

### [Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning](https://github.com/neerajghate/customer-segmentation)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-blue)
![K-means](https://img.shields.io/badge/Algorithm-K--means-green)
![Data Analysis](https://img.shields.io/badge/Task-Data%20Analysis-yellow)

Leveraged K-means clustering to categorize customers based on spending behaviors, resulting in actionable insights for business strategies. Extensive data analysis and visualization were conducted to identify distinct customer segments and their unique preferences.
